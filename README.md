# LHCb-classification
Can we see differences between matter and antimatter from their LHCb collision data on a statistically significant level?
 

## Project description (written by Dr. William Barter)

The LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider seeks to understand why the Universe is matter-dominated. Our current best theory of the universe at high energies and quantum lengths, the Standard Model, fails to explain the current matter/antimatter asymmetry of the Universe: there must be new physical forces and phenomena responsible for this asymmetry. 

It is therefore critical to find the best method to find differences between matter and antimatter. At base, this is a statistical problem: are two samples consistent with each other, or do they exhibit fundamental differences. The project will therefore study real data collected at the LHCb experiment at the LHC to investigate the most sensitive tests for sample differences. You will study the decays of heavy flavour particles and their antimatter conjugate processes. In certain regions of the decay phase space, the matter/antimatter differences are as large as 70%, thereby providing a great laboratory for testing different methods.

The project will be python based and will employ a variety of different tests suggested in the literature: a simple chi^2 comparison -also known as a 'Miranda' test; a more complex test, known as 'the energy test'; a newly proposed test based on the 'Earth Mover's distance' statistic; and potentially machine learning methods.
